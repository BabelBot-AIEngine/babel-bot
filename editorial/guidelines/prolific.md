## Why do we need a content style guide? ü§î

The Prolific brand is strong and unique. We've built it on a set stylistic rules that ensure consistency and make us sound like us - and no-one else. It's our personality and it helps us with every aspect of our business, from financial growth to customer satisfaction.

And it needs to shine through with every piece of content we produce.

This content style guide keeps us all on the same page in how we write for Prolific. It ensures that everything we produce is clear, consistent, and powerful.

## What are voice and tone? üó£üìû

Think of the way you speak: the sounds, words and phrases that are unique to you. That's your voice.

How you use your voice changes depending on who you're talking to, where, and when. These are tones.

Prolific has the same things.

- **Voice:** Prolific's personality, rhythm, and word choice. This is chosen specifically to establish a relationship with the reader.
- **Tone:** The way we adapt our personality to suit different situations, topics, or audiences. We have a few different tones depending on the context of the interaction. Who is reading it? Where? How do you want them to feel?

## How to adapt our voice to different channels üì±

You'll need to adapt our voice slightly to suit the expectations and conventions of different channels. Here's how to keep our ACE principles while tailoring our voice for specific platforms:

### Website

**Tone focus:** Authoritative and Clear

The website is often the first impression people have of Prolific. Use concise, confident language to show our expertise while making complex ideas easy to understand.

- ‚úÖ Keep navigation labels and CTAs short and direct.

### Blogs, articles, and whitepapers

Adapt the tone of our voice based on the platform:
- **LinkedIn:** Professional but approachable, with an emphasis on authority.
- **Facebook:** Community-oriented and engaging, using approachable language.
- **X:** Punchy, conversational, and bold.
- **Reddit:** Strictly community-oriented, casual, human, and direct‚Äîwe need to match the energy of a typical Reddit user.

**Writing tips:**
- ‚úÖ Use emojis on LinkedIn, Facebook, and X to make posts fun and visually engaging‚Äîbut don't overuse them! Avoid using emojis on Reddit.
- ‚úÖ Keep posts short and direct; link to longer content for details.
- ‚úÖ Tailor the tone to reflect the platform's audience‚Äîmore professional for LinkedIn, more casual for X and Facebook.

### Emails (Customer service and Newsletters)

**Tone focus:** Clear and Energized

Emails should be helpful and engaging, creating a personal connection with the reader.

**Customer service emails:**
- **Authoritative:** Be direct and solutions-focused.
  - Example: "Here's how you can resolve this issue in three steps‚Ä¶"
- **Clear:** Break instructions into bullet points for clarity.
- **Energized:** End with an encouraging note.
  - Example: "We're here to help‚Äîlet us know if you need further assistance!"

**Newsletters:**
- **Authoritative:** Share updates and thought leadership.
- **Clear:** Highlight key points with headings and summaries.

**Writing tips:**
- ‚úÖ Use a warm, approachable tone for customer service.
- ‚úÖ Keep newsletters concise; link to full content on the website.
- ‚úÖ Personalize when possible (e.g., addressing the recipient by name).

### In-app copy

**Tone focus:** Clear and Energized

With in-app copy, clarity is key to guide users efficiently while maintaining an energized tone that reflects Prolific's enthusiasm and user-centric approach. Every word should help users accomplish their goals with confidence and ease.

- **Clear:** Use concise, instructional language to ensure users immediately understand what to do next.
  - Example: "Create a new study by clicking the button below."
- **Energized:** Keep the tone friendly and positive to make the experience enjoyable.

**Writing tips:**
- ‚úÖ **Be action-oriented:** Use direct calls to action like "Update" or "Publish" to guide users.
- ‚úÖ **Keep it minimal:** Avoid overwhelming users with long sentences or too much detail.

### Help center articles

Help center articles should be straightforward, concise, and solution-focused.

## Legal language guidelines

To ensure compliance with legal standards and protect Prolific's role as a platform facilitating transactions, our copy must align with specific language choices. Follow these guidelines to reduce legal risk and ensures our communications reflect our core values and operational role.

### Participants are paid by researchers, not Prolific

Ensure all references to payment clarify that participants are compensated by researchers through our platform, not by Prolific directly.

| Do say ‚úÖ | Don't say ‚ùå |
|-----------|--------------|
| Participants are paid by researchers via Prolific. | Prolific pays participants. |

### Framing impact: Empowerment, not ownership

Position Prolific as enabling researchers and participants to drive impact, not as the primary driver of impact itself.

| Do say ‚úÖ | Don't say ‚ùå |
|-----------|--------------|
| Explore how Prolific helps researchers drive meaningful impact. | Discover the impact that Prolific creates. |

### Terms to avoid and preferred alternatives

- **"Vetting":** This term implies training, which can suggest employment. Use alternatives like "verification" or "validation."
  - Example: Use "Participants undergo verification to ensure quality" instead of "Participants are vetted for quality."
  
- **"Bonus":** This term implies a contractual or employment-related incentive. Use terms like "incentive" or "additional payment."
  - Example: Use "Researchers may provide an incentive for completing studies" rather than "Researchers may provide a bonus."

## Grammar, writing, and style rules ‚úçÔ∏è

When writing for Prolific, we stick to certain spelling, grammar, and style rules. This helps us keep our writing clear and consistent - which is key for securing trust.

While voice and tone can flex based on context, these rules are our house style, and they apply to all content published by Prolific, and on Prolific's channels.

### American English

Though we're headquartered in the UK, Prolific uses American English, not British English. This reflects the global reach of our business.

Keep an eye out for some of these common spelling differences:

#### ‚Ä¶our/‚Ä¶or
British English words that end in 'our' usually end in 'or' in American English.

| British English ‚ùå | American English ‚úÖ |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Colour | Color |
| Humour | Humor |
| Labour | Labor |

#### ‚Ä¶ise/‚Ä¶ize
Words that can end in 'ise' in British English end in 'ize' in American English almost all the time.

| British English ‚ùå | American English ‚úÖ |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Apologise | Apologize |
| Organise | Organize |
| Recognise | Recognize |

#### ‚Ä¶ence/‚Ä¶ense
Some words that end with 'ence' in British English are spelled 'ense' in American English.

| British English ‚ùå | American English ‚úÖ |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Defence | Defense |
| Licence | License |
| Offence | Offense |

### Active voice

Use the active voice and avoid the passive voice.

In the active voice, the subject of the sentence does the action: *Joe closes the gate.*

In the passive voice, the subject is the person or thing being acted on: *The gate was closed by Joe.*

Using the active voice makes your writing clearer, confident, concise, and direct.

| Active voice ‚úÖ | Passive voice ‚ùå |
|-----------------|------------------|
| We value our participants, so we treat them well. | Participants are valued by Prolific, so they are treated well. |
| Smart, engaged respondents deliver rich and definitive data. | Rich and definitive data is delivered by smart, engaged respondents. |
| We monitor and improve the quality of our participant pool. | The quality of our participant pool is monitored and improved. |

### Dates and times

We use the US system when writing out dates and times.

To avoid confusion in other markets, we write the name of the month.

This means that for written dates, we use the following structure: [Month] [Number], [Year].

For example:
- June 11, 2024

Times should be written using a 12-hour clock, with consistent use of AM/PM. For example:
- 11:00 AM
- 4:00 PM

### Exclamation marks

Use exclamation marks sparingly. Don't use two or more next to each other.

Too many exclamation marks make your writing seem shout-y and overbearing. If you're in doubt, don't use them.

| Use exclamation marks sparingly ‚úÖ | Don't overuse exclamation marks ‚ùå |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| We held our Prolific summer BBQ last week. The team had a blast! | We held our Prolific summer BBQ last week! The team had a blast!!! |

### Numbers

We use numbers for any amount larger than 10. We write out numbers from one to nine.

In cases where you don't have much space, like heading or buttons, you can write out numbers from one to nine.

We use commas to break out numbers that have at least five figures so they are more easily scannable. For example: Your account balance is ¬£10,386.12.

Shorten numbers that are six figures or longer (e.g. 200,000 to 200k). Write out numbers that are five figures or shorter in full (e.g. 20,000). Where space is at a premium, such as copy for ads or headlines, you can shorten numbers that are four or five figures as well.

### Capitalization

We use sentence case everywhere, including buttons, titles, and headings. This is because sentence case is easier for most audiences to understand, and faster to read.

The only words that we should capitalize in a sentence are:
- The first letter of the sentence
- Brand and company names (e.g: Prolific, PayPal, Onfido, Gorilla, Hyperwallet, etc.)

‚ùì **What is sentence case?**
Sentence case is a way of writing that only uses capital letters at the start of sentences and for proper nouns. This is different to title case, in which we may capitalize other words in a title or button to bring emphasis to those actions. [Read more here.](link)

| Sentence case ‚úÖ | Title case ‚ùå |
|------------------|---------------|
| How to write the perfect consent form for research | How to Write the Perfect Consent Form for Research |

### Emojis

Emojis are fine to use in social media posts, blog content, and support chats. You can use them within text, but not imagery. However, make sure any emoji you use is easy to understand for all audiences.

### Full stops and headers

When writing headers in content, we do not end the header with a full stop.

However, if the header includes more than one statement that is separated by one or more full stops, we do end the final statement of the header with a full stop.

| Do write ‚úÖ | Don't write ‚ùå |
|-------------|----------------|
| How to write the perfect consent form for research | How to write the perfect consent form for research. |
| Build specialist AI faster. Get verified expertise in hours. | Build specialist AI faster. Get verified expertise in hours |

### Bold, italics, and underline

Avoid using bold and italics to emphasise a point.

Do not use bold or italic fonts.

Never underline text to emphasise a point.

### Acronyms and jargon

Our writing is clear, engaging, and accessible. So avoid using business and technical jargon as much as possible. Steer clear of these common jargon terms.

| Do say ‚úÖ | Don't say ‚ùå |
|-----------|--------------|
| Use | Leverage |
| Make progress | Move the needle |
| Use our own products | Eat our own dogfood |

In cases where we need to use an acronym, we should write out the abbreviated words in full the first time it's used.

There are some exceptions to this, for example:
- **ID:** this abbreviation is well-known, and frequently used throughout Prolific
- **URL:** this abbreviation is more well-known than 'uniform resource locator'. If possible, we should consider alternatives, like 'link'.

When using acronyms, always provide the full spelling of the word first, with the acronym in parentheses after it.

### Contractions

Use contractions. They make your writing more concise, casual, and human.

| Do say ‚úÖ | Don't say ‚ùå |
|-----------|--------------|
| Can't | Cannot |
| You're | You are |
| We'll | We will |

### Lists

Numbered lists and bullet lists are a useful way to make information easier to scan for our audience.

Lists should be 3-5 lines long. If you only have 2 points, this should be a sentence. If you have more than 5 points, consider restructuring the content to communicate less information to the user.

Each line of a list should:
- Make sense if you read it with the initial read-in line
- Start with a capital
- Not contain punctuation at the end
- Be a short, simple sentence

### Oxford comma

Use the Oxford comma consistently in Prolific content.

| Do say ‚úÖ | Don't say ‚ùå |
|-----------|--------------|
| Our integrated partners Gorilla, Typeform, and Jotform | Our integrated partners Gorilla, Typeform and Jotform |
| We're delighted to work with people from academia, industry, and business | We're delighted to work with people from academia, industry and business |

### Writing about Prolific

A few key rules to follow when using the word Prolific:
- The word Prolific is always capitalized.
- Refer to Prolific as 'we,' not 'it.' This suggests the sense of ownership we have of our business.
- When writing about Prolific as an organization, use the singular: "Prolific is participating."
